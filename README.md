## Features
> A basic visualiser for sorting algorithms. It currently demonstrates the implementation of the following algorithms: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort. Buttons in the playground are descriptively named. Click on `Generate new list` to create a random list of unsorted bars. Clicking on either of the sorting buttons shows how these algorithms work. Hover on the sorting buttons to see a tooltip with the worst case of each algorithm.
