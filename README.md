## Features
> A basic visualiser for advanced sorting algorithms. It currently demonstrates the implementation of the Merge sort and Quick sort algorithms. Buttons in the playground are descriptively named. Click on `Generate new list` to create a random list of unsorted bars.
Clicking on either of the sorting buttons shows how these algorithms work.
