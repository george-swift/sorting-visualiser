## Heap Sort
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure
to build a _max-heap_ (for ascending order) or _min-heap_ (for descending order) and then
sorts the collection.

The worst-case time complexity of Heap Sort is **O(n log n),** making it efficient for
large datasets. Heap Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm with the advantage of being
not sensitive to the initial order of elements in the input array.

Hereâ€™s some pseudocode for Heap Sort:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={solarizedlight}>
  {`procedure heapSort(A: list)
    // Build a max-heap
    buildMaxHeap(A)

    // Extract elements from the heap one by one
    for i from length(A) - 1 to 1 do
        // Swap the root (maximum element) with the last element
        swap(A[0], A[i])

        // Reduce the heap size and heapify the root
        heapify(A, 0, i)

    procedure buildMaxHeap(A: list)
      n = length(A)

      // Start from the last non-leaf node and heapify all nodes
      for i from n / 2 - 1 down to 0 do
          heapify(A, i, n)

    procedure heapify(A: list, i: integer, heapSize: integer)
      largest = i
      leftChild = 2 * i + 1
      rightChild = 2 * i + 2

      // Compare with left child
      if leftChild < heapSize and A[leftChild] > A[largest] then
          largest = leftChild

      // Compare with right child
      if rightChild < heapSize and A[rightChild] > A[largest] then
          largest = rightChild

      // If the largest element is not the root, swap and heapify the affected sub-tree
      if largest != i then
          swap(A[i], A[largest])
          heapify(A, largest, heapSize)`}
