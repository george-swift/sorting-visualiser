## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quick sort, heap sort, or merge sort.

However, it performs well for small datasets that are nearly sorted. The basic idea behind Insertion Sort is to iterate
through the dataset, take one element at a time, and insert it into its correct position in the already sorted part
of the dataset.

The worst-case time complexity of Insertion Sort is **O(n^2)** when the dataset is in reverse order, and each element must
be compared and shifted to the beginning of the sorted part. Hereâ€™s a simple pseudocode for Insertion Sort:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={solarizedlight}>
{`procedure insertionSort(A: list)
    for i from 1 to length(A) - 1 do
        currentElement = A[i]
        j = i - 1

        while j >= 0 and A[j] > currentElement do
            A[j + 1] = A[j]
            j = j - 1

        A[j + 1] = currentElement`}
