## How does this visualiser work?

It’s a program that visually demonstrates how sorting algorithms work by
displaying the step-by-step process of sorting a collection represented
by bars in the playground.

You can observe how the bars move and rearrange during each step of the
sorting process. This visualisation should help you grasp the
algorithm’s behaviour and understand the time complexity of sorting
operations.

## What are sorting algorithms? And which ones are shown here?

These are methods or instructions used to arrange elements in a specific
order within a collection. In the playground, the sorting algorithm
selected will sort the bars in ascending order from the shortest to the
tallest.

There are numerous sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and
disadvantages in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and
stability. In this visualiser, we demonstrate the following: <span>Insertion Sort, Merge Sort,
Quick Sort,</span> and <span>Heap Sort</span>.
