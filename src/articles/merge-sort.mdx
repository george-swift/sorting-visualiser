## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
It works by recursively dividing a collection into halves, sorting each half, and then merging
the sorted halves to produce a fully sorted collection.

It’s known for its stable nature (maintains the relative order of equal elements) and consistent
**O(n log n)** time complexity for worst, average, and best cases. However, it requires additional
space proportional to the size of the collection for temporary storage during the merging process.

Despite the space complexity, its predictable performance makes it a popular choice for sorting
large datasets. Here’s some pseudocode for Merge Sort:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={solarizedlight}>
  {`procedure mergeSort(A: list)
      if length(A) <= 1 then
            return A

      middle = length(A) / 2
      left = A[0:middle-1]
      right = A[middle:end]

      left = mergeSort(left)
      right = mergeSort(right)

      result = merge(left, right)

      return result

    procedure merge(left: list, right: list)
      result = []
      leftIndex = 0
      rightIndex = 0

      while leftIndex < length(left) and rightIndex < length(right) do
        if left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex] then
            result.append(left[leftIndex])
            leftIndex = leftIndex + 1
        else
            result.append(right[rightIndex])
            rightIndex = rightIndex + 1

      // Append the remaining elements from both lists
      result.extend(left[leftIndex:])
      result.extend(right[rightIndex:])

      return result`}
