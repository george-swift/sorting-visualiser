## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a _pivot_ element from
the collection and _partitioning_ the other elements into two sub-collections according to whether
they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-collections are then sorted recursively.

The worst-case time complexity of Quick Sort is **O(n^2),** which occurs when the pivot selection consistently
results in unbalanced partitions. However, on average, Quick Sort exhibits an **O(n log n)** time complexity,
making it efficient for large datasets.

Strategies like choosing a random pivot or partitioning in three ways, can be used to reduce the likelihood
of worst-case scenarios. Hereâ€™s some pseudocode for Quick Sort:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={solarizedlight}>
  {`procedure quickSort(A: list, low: integer, high: integer)
    if low < high then
      // Partition the array, q is the index of the pivot
      q = partition(A, low, high)

      // Recursively sort the sub-lists
      quickSort(A, low, q - 1)
      quickSort(A, q + 1, high)

    procedure partition(A: list, low: integer, high: integer): integer
      // Choose the rightmost element as the pivot
      pivot = A[high]

      // Index of the smaller element
      i = low - 1

      for j from low to high - 1 do
          if A[j] <= pivot then
              i = i + 1
              // Swap A[i] and A[j]
              swap(A[i], A[j])

      // Swap A[i + 1] and A[high] (put the pivot in its correct place)
      swap(A[i + 1], A[high])

      return i + 1`}
